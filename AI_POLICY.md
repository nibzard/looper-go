# AI Contribution Policy

**Last updated**: January 2025

## Overview

Looper-Go is an AI agent orchestration tool. We believe AI assistance is a legitimate and valuable part of modern software development. We welcome AI-assisted contributions while maintaining quality standards.

## Our Philosophy

> "This is a pro-AI stance. We use AI, we build tools for AI, and we welcome AI-assisted contributions."

We recognize that:
- AI tools are here to stay
- AI can accelerate development and learning
- Human oversight remains essential
- Quality matters more than how code was produced

## Requirements for AI-Assisted Contributions

### 1. Disclosure

All AI-assisted contributions must disclose the use of AI in the pull request description.

**Examples:**
- "This PR was written with assistance from Claude Code."
- "I used ChatGPT to help understand the codebase structure."
- "AI assistance: Code generation and test writing."

### 2. Testing

- All changes must pass tests
- Test on platforms you have access to
- Don't use AI to write code for platforms you can't test

### 3. Understanding

- Be prepared to explain your changes
- You should understand what the code does
- Be available for follow-up questions

### 4. Quality

- Code should follow project conventions
- Changes should be well-tested
- Documentation should be accurate

## Encouraged Uses

✅ **We encourage:**
- Using AI for code generation and refactoring
- AI-assisted test writing
- Learning from AI explanations
- Using AI agents to explore the codebase
- AI-assisted documentation writing
- Translation for non-native English speakers

## Discouraged Uses

❌ **We discourage:**
- Submitting untested AI-generated code
- Bulk AI-generated PRs without review
- Using AI for code you don't understand
- AI-generated issue comments without human oversight

## AI Tools We Use

## License Note

AI-generated code contributed to this project becomes part of the MIT-licensed codebase. By contributing, you confirm you have the right to submit the code under these terms.

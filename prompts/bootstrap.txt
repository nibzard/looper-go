Initialize a task backlog for this project.

{{if .UserPrompt}}
User Prompt:
{{.UserPrompt}}

Rules:
- Brainstorm and expand the user's idea into a comprehensive set of actionable tasks.
- Create "{{.TodoPath}}" using the schema in "{{.SchemaPath}}".
- Set source_files to [] since this is prompt-driven bootstrapping.
- Break down the user's idea into specific, implementable tasks.
- Assign each task priority (1 is highest).
- Set all task statuses to "todo".
- Do not modify code or other files.
- Use jq if helpful.
- Do not ask for confirmation.

Return a brief summary of what you created.
{{else}}
Rules:
- Read the current directory ({{.WorkDir}}) to understand the project.

- Create "{{.TodoPath}}" using the schema in "{{.SchemaPath}}".
- Populate source_files with the relative paths (from project root) of the source docs you found. If none, set source_files to [].
- Add as many actionable tasks that are needed to fully implement the project.
- Assign each task priority (1 is highest).
- Set all task statuses to "todo".

Initialize a task backlog for this project.

{{if .UserPrompt}}
User Prompt:
{{.UserPrompt}}

Rules:
- Brainstorm and expand the user's idea into a comprehensive set of actionable tasks.
- Create "{{.TodoPath}}" using the schema in "{{.SchemaPath}}".
- Set source_files to [] since this is prompt-driven bootstrapping.
- Break down the user's idea into specific, implementable tasks.
- For each task, provide:
  - title: A concise, actionable summary (required)
  - description: A detailed explanation of what the task involves (recommended)
  - reference: Relevant file paths, URLs, or documentation links (recommended)
  - priority: 1-5 (1 is highest)
  - status: "todo" for all new tasks
  - details: Any additional implementation notes or constraints (optional)
  - steps: An array of specific sub-steps if the task is complex (optional)
  - tags: Relevant categories like "cli", "agents", "config", etc. (optional)
  - files: Files this task will modify (optional)
- Do not modify code or other files.
- Use jq if helpful.
- Do not ask for confirmation.

Return a brief summary of what you created.
{{else}}
Rules:
- Read the current directory ({{.WorkDir}}) to understand the project.
- Search for markdown source docs like PROJECT.md, PROJECT_SPEC.md, SPECS.md, SPECIFICATION.md, README.md, DESIGN.md, IDEA.md, etc.
- Create "{{.TodoPath}}" using the schema in "{{.SchemaPath}}".
- Populate source_files with the relative paths (from project root) of the source docs you found. If none, set source_files to [].
- Add as many actionable tasks that are needed to fully implement the project.

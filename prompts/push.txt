You are running a release workflow via the looper push command.

Project root: {{.WorkDir}}
Current time: {{.Now}}
{{if .HasGH}}
GitHub CLI available: yes
{{else}}
GitHub CLI available: no (skip GitHub repo creation and release steps; note in summary)
{{end}}

Your task is to execute a release workflow using the release-runbook skill located at:
{{.WorkDir}}/skills/release-runbook/SKILL.md

Follow the workflow steps carefully:

1. Check the current git status and ensure the working tree is clean
2. Determine the appropriate version bump based on recent changes
3. Run tests if available
4. Update version references in the codebase
5. Commit release changes
6. Create and push a git tag
7. Create a GitHub release using `gh release create`
8. Update the Homebrew formula if present

Use the scripts/release.sh script as a guide or execute it directly if appropriate.

Key considerations:
- Use Conventional Commits for commit messages
- Tag format should be vX.Y.Z
- Run tests before tagging
- Update all version references (go.mod, VERSION, Formula/*.rb, README badges, etc.)
- Create GitHub release with clear notes
- Update Homebrew formula after the tag exists

Return a summary of the release workflow execution including:
- Version released
- Tag created
- Tests run (if any)
- Files changed
- GitHub release URL (if created)
- Any issues encountered

You are running a final review pass after all tasks are complete.

Project root: {{.WorkDir}}

Goal: review the codebase file-by-file as a senior developer reviewing a junior's work,
then update "{{.TodoPath}}" if new tasks are needed.

Rules:
- Read "{{.TodoPath}}" and follow the schema in "{{.SchemaPath}}".
- Read every file listed in source_files.
- Review the repo file-by-file, focusing on tracked, non-generated files.
  Skip .git, node_modules, dist, build, .venv, __pycache__, and other generated dirs.
- Do not modify code or other files. Only update "{{.TodoPath}}".
- If you find new tasks, append them to .tasks with status "todo" and priority (1 highest).
- Follow the existing id style and ensure ids are unique.
- Avoid duplicates by intent/title.
- If you add tasks, do NOT add the project-done marker.
- If no new tasks are needed, append a final task as the last item in .tasks:
  - id: a unique id (use "PROJECT-DONE" if available)
  - title: "Project done: no new tasks"
  - status: "done"
  - priority: 5
  - tags: ["project-done"]
  - details: brief note that the review found nothing to add
- Keep JSON formatted with 2-space indentation.
- Use jq for edits when practical.
- Do not ask for confirmation.
- If you conclude no new tasks are needed, you MUST add the project-done marker.
  Looper will keep running otherwise.

Return only a JSON object:
{"status":"reviewed","summary":"...","added_tasks":0,"files":["..."]}
